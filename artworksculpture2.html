                <h3>My Right Hand</h3>
                <p>Alga casting, plaster; Fall, 2018</p>
                <p>My right hand with a pen in it, and back of my hand is a Chinese acient poetry as an encouragement for myself means: persevereance. My purpose for this project is to present that people used to write on paper with pen. In ascient times, they even wrote on the stone, bamboo, wood, and etc. After invention of computers, many people do not write anymore. The characters will be lose such as Chinese. When I was child practicing a lot colligraphy, it is hard to learn to write Chinese characters, and the only way to remember them is through practicing hand writing. Every Chinese character has its' paticular meaning. When typing them on computer, people wouldn't think of why and how the characters were formed and what are their meanings, but simply consider them as icons. I can still read letters written by my grandpa in 1970's about the Culture Revolution in China at that time. I felt he is still in my mind when I read his letters. They are his handwriting have infused his emotions in them. I feel cherished and understood his situation when I read them. While, high-tech company are trying to make anything possible to stimulate people's life in order to replace the traditional way of living, but people still feel empty enough to need more and more entertaiment, because those are machines without feelings.</p>
