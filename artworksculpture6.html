                <h3>Greed</h3>
                <p>Fair Cup (Greedy cup) Ceramic, green, glazed, 2019</p>
                <p> It is a cup-shaped sculpture made by porcelain with a dragon's head is placed in the centre of it can store water and alcohol. It is called Fair cup, also known as Greedy Cup, which was used for drinking by ancient people of the Han Dynasty more than two thousand years ago. 
It is based on the principle of physics siphon. There is a hole in the joint between the dragon's head and the bottom of the cup. When water is pouring into the cup if the water level is lower than the upper mouth of the porcelain tube, the water will not leak out; When the water level exceeds the top opening of the porcelain tube, the water leaks through the leaking hole at the bottom of the cup. In ancient times, when the emperor bestowed on the ministers a drink, they should not greet too much. It could not overfill; otherwise, all the wine in the cup would be flown out without leaving a drop. The emperor wanted to tell his ministers must be justice but not greed to their country and their people. 
I wanted to use the cup as well as the ancient wisdom to convey my perspective about the project: greed. We are living in an era of material consumption, and people tend to buy more than they needed because of the advertisements from social media. People's sense of value and willpower have been texted all the time by temptations such as achievement, reputation, and status. Greed is like a demon, and greedy people can never be calm and satisfied. They would become the brainless slaves of money and material without the ability of logical reasoning. Right or wrong is not essential as long as something can benefit them. They do not appreciate what they have, but the more they gained, the more they wanted while forgetting what they need. Their cruel vanity can cause them to lose what are important to them as well as cause problem for the society they live in.</p>

                <p>The unrestrained desire for money, power, knowledge, and sexual is greed. Western philosophy uses reason to satisfy one's own desires because it believes that human-beings are born greedy and selfish, so it needs the social norms means the external force "law" to control people's behavior, which is not their instinctive will. Many people break laws to get what they wanted even though they are working at law enforcement. However, in ancient Confucianism of the Eastern society believed that people are born kind-hearted. Yet the incorrect value systems of society would mislead people to pursue their desires without concerning ethical standards. People with weak willpower are hard to resist the wealth and temptation. Therefore, it says that people can control their behavior by cultivating their internal morality, which is moderation. Buddhism refers that differences between human-beings and animals is people's conscience, but from psychological aspect is to say that the sense of insecurity also creates another product of greed. I would like to leave the famous saying in China is that "Happiness lies in contentment."
