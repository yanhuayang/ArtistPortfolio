                <h3>Disparity</h3>
                <p>found material newspaper, watercolor, overlap, Dec.2017, De Anza</p>
                <p>The front of this painting are homelesses sleeing on the street. The back of this wall are comercial center with high building and Trump's scandars shows on the one of the buildings. Thie piece supposes to explain that the disparity between rich and poor are high along with developing the high technology. The rate of unemployment has been increased in recent days. Most low level labors have been replaced by machines. I have experiened this at the first hand because every time I go back my country China from the US there are some changes related to high technologies. The primary change is there are more AI (Artificial Intelligence) than workers in some industry. On the other hand, The process of developing is pretty fast, so many people have no knowledge to adapt it efficiently. They feel inferior and have to choose to retreat from the model society. Most of them are last generation have been sacrificed for this country for several decades, but they have to accept the second elimination of fate to be viped out. However, when I return from China to the US, the custom has been changed as well. The passport are scaned by the machines not human being anymore. Even though there are guidlines showing on the screen, some users still need help when processing but hard to find help. How nervous they would because so many people are waiting behind them. In the point tha t high technology has changed the way of how people greet to one another. They also change the way of living that few people can hold more rescources, but others have to become homelesses. </p>
