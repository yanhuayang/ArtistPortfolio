                            <p> I grew up like a wild child trying to practice many kinds of sports, and I have learned them mostly were self-taught. They would become a part of my passion after I overcame them. I have used the way to pursue and create my art. My works are mainly digital art and paintings with multiple disciplines: social justice, identities, intercultural, and environment. I play upon my sensibilities, which obtained from my family and my experiences of interacting with different cultures. I make my work to start from communicating with my thoughts, then to become the idea to generate a visible art piece.

      My 3D animations draw from the environmental changing of my home country in China. The first animated scene is to symbolize how the environment changes, along with developing high technology. People used to adventure nature was to go with friends, but now they adventure websites instead. My videos are also about cultural interaction and the environment changes by developing high technology. My final project is to demonstrate how mobile-phone has become the biggest controller with it's a significant impact to people in China and all over the world. The addiction to media primarily forms from anxiety because of the competitive environment. The mobile phone also lead the electronic currency to replace the cash because paying by phone with QR code is easy and convenient while stimulating consumption, and how capitalism has held all internet recourses to manipulate people's mind and control the whole consuming market.

      From my childhood until now, high technology has contributed a significant part of life-changing. Technological devices have transformed the entire world. Authorities have been gaining more power through advanced technology. My works are authentic in real life. They are original rather than borrowing ideas from anyone else. I will keep on my way to make art while uncovering the veil behind the high technology. I will make more art about how Artificial Intelligence, the strange species will be the potential enemy for our life in the current and future and how some good ways or critical thinking needs to be employed when we spend time on social media.
