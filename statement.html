                            <p> I grew up like a wild child trying to practice many kinds of sports, and I have learned them mostly were self taught and experiment. They would become a part of my passion after I overcame them. I used this way to pursue what I like internally in my life and art. My artworks are mainly related to identities, humanities, cultures, environment, and medias. I play upon my sensibilities, which have been obtained from my family background and my experiences of interacting with different cultures. I communicate with my artworks start from an idea to form an idea to an artwork.

      My 3D animations draws from the environmental changing of my home country in China. The first animated scene is to symbolize how environment changes along with developing the high technology. People used to adventure nature was to go with friends, but now they adventure websites instead. My videos is also connected to environment changes by high technology. My final project is to demonstrate how phone has become a biggest controller with  a huge impact to people in China and all over the world as well. The addiction of phone is primaryly formed by anxiety because of the competitive environment. Second, cash has been replaced by electronic currency because paying by phone with QR code is easy and convenient. Third, to explain how capitalism has hold all internet recourses to manipulate people and control the whole consuming marke.

      From my childhood until now, the high technology have contributed a great part of life changing. The entire world have been gradually changing as well. How authorities have been gaining more power through high technologies to control all the social trends. I make my artworks are more authentic to our real life. They are original rather  than borrowing ideas from other artists.  I will keep on my way to make art and uncover the veil behind the high technology. I will make some artworks in the future about how good ways or critical thinking needs to be employed when we spend time on high technology devices.
