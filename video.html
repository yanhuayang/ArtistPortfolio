                            <h4 class="work-title">Language is human right</h4>
                            <p>Living abroad without good language skills is like having legs can't walk, because you are afraid to do what you wanted. Language is contributed by it's culture. They are not just different from their pronounciation and characters, but the way how you commumicate with the world and the way how you write your words to share. The most part of difference is also the harddist part to master any type of laguanges is that different language systems such as Latin language system is compeletely different from Chinese language system. As an America, you may easier to learn Spanish rather than Japanese. Primaryly, many recourses are only writen by English as well. To master English is like you hold more rights. Vise versa, if you are not familier with any laguage with the country you live you will lose more rights and experience more difficulties.

                                <h4 class="work-title">Simplicity</h4>
                                <p>I was like a blank paper before living abroad. I tried to catch everything up that I couldn't reach in my home country, because I thought I should have but I lost in my life before. I was overwhelmed by the information fromm all over the world when I just came here. I tried to read them as possible as I could, finally I realised that it couldn't make me happier. I wanted to get my life back to the traditional way of living: nature and simplicity because I couldn't change that information symmetry or asymmetry have been becoming a standard to value people whether they are intelligent or not. </p>

                                <p>High technology divices have been eroded our families, relationship, and the way of thinking since the firt smartphone was invented. At the same time more and more brutal and ruthless industry elites have been produced with the development of high technology as well. They remotely control the smartphone to manipulate general's mind and the whole comsuming market where we are living. They can decide what we should follow and how the way we live in this remote control society. This video is to discover the impact of phone for daily lives in China. Be a critical thinker is so important because the society needs you.(The background of this video is Shenzhen, China.)</q>

                                <h4 class="work-title">What I Learned in College</h4>
                                <p>This is a situation every international student will encounter when studying abroad. You thought you have spent five or more years in another coutry and read a lot would be enough to have good communiation skills. This video would tell you the truth after 4 years in America. It is normal to lose your confidence in foreign coutry with unfamiliar language skills. You should believe this is just a normal process, so you would maintian the good mantality. Don't trust any advertisement about "learning English only needs 8 months". You can do some adventure in college to talk with peers and make some firends to learn some slans would be pretty fun. It takes time to get your ear used to it. Be patient! Patient! Patient!

                                <h4 class="work-title">Flexibility vs Regidity</h4>
                                <p>I wrote this code is called: interacte processing. The ractangle line with two little big circles are rigid, but the little green tinny circle is flaxible. They are functioning very different ways because the flaxible one can make any patterns you wanted, but the rigid three can only make straight lines with limited patterns. While,they are reconcided to each other very well. Hence, you can design any colors to draw your favorite patterns on the Canvas.
